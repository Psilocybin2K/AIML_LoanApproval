## 💬 Interacting with the System

The system supports both command-based and natural language interactions:

```
> /CreateLightGbmModel
> /Predict 720 85000 250000 30
> Update FICO as 780
> Update Loan Amount to 120K
```

## 🏢 Business Benefits

- **Enhanced Decision Making** - Reduce human bias while increasing approval accuracy
- **Improved Efficiency** - Automate routine approvals while focusing human review on edge cases
- **Risk Management** - Consistently apply your organization's risk policies
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Maintain detailed records of decision factors for regulatory review
- **Customer Satisfaction** - Provide faster loan decisions with transparent reasoning

## 🔧 Getting Started

1. Configure your OpenAI API key as an environment variable
2. Ensure your loan data is formatted according to the system specifications
3. Run the application and create your initial model
4. Begin making predictions or customizing the model to your needs

## 🔍 Example Usage

```
> /CreateLightGbmModel
Creating and training model...
Model created and trained successfully.

> /UpdateSample 750 120000 300000 30 35
Sample updated successfully.

> /Predict
Loan approved with 92.3% confidence.
Key factors: Strong credit history, healthy debt-to-income ratio, and stable employment.
```

## ⚖️ Anti-Bias Measures

We take the challenge of algorithmic bias seriously. Our approach to responsible AI includes:

- **Machine Learning for Consistent Decisions** - The core loan approval predictions are handled by ML.NET's LightGBM model, which provides consistent application of criteria across all applicants
- **AI-Assisted, Not AI-Decided** - The system's natural language capabilities (powered by GPT models) assist with interactive instructions and providing insights, but final decisions remain under human supervision
- **Transparency in Feature Importance** - The system can explain which factors influenced each prediction, enabling review for potential bias
- **Continuous Evaluation** - Regular monitoring of approval rates across demographic groups to identify and address any emerging patterns

> **Note:** We acknowledge that any AI application, including this one, carries some potential for bias. Training data inevitably reflects historical human decisions which may contain biases. Users should implement appropriate governance and review processes when deploying this system.
